# Exploring EMS settings and parameters

Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) estabelishes a circuit between your muscles (which might include muscle fibers and nerves), this means that electrical parameters (intensity) and signal parameters (frequency and pulse width) matter a lot. 

##0. Video tutorial on basics of EMS

Before diving into the secondary parameters such as pulse witdh and frequency, make sure you are familiar with the basics. Here's a <a href="http://plopes.org/ems/#testingEMSmachine">video tutorial</a> on how to get started with a off the shelf TENS/EMS device. 

##1. How do EMS signals look like? 

EMS waveforms can differet depending on which machine is generating these. The majority of machines use a biphasic pulse, which means it has a positive and negative side: 


### EMS signals

### A quick word about voltage vs currentâ€¦ 
EMS machines typically are current driven, this means when you are rotating the dial, the amplifiers inside will regulate the voltage to reach the current that you want to send to the muscles (remember the <a href="http://">Ohm's Law relationship between Voltage and Current?</a>). So when you read in your oscilloscope something like 20V or 50V while using an EMS machine, remember that albeit this sounding like a "lot of volts" that is probably only "a little current", like 10mA or so which in fact might be less than you need to power an arduino. For comparison a 9V block has 200mA of energy inside. 

##2. Intensity

Intensity tells you directly how intense will be the muscle contraction. This is typically measured in milliamps (mAmps). Most EMS machines will be current-capped at 70 or 100mA. 

Note that some machines have arbitrary scales (such as 1-10) or so and these do not map directly to mA. The sports medicine community has studied EMS for their applications, here'a s few words from them with regards to increasing the amplitude:

-  Increase the depth of penetration
- Increase the number of neurons depolarized
- Amplitude should be adjusted to produce a desired physiologic response
- Physiologic response is the key, do not focus on the number of milliamps.

With "Physiologic response" it is meant what this will cause in your body: 
1. to do
2. 

lastly, keep in mind that this is the intensity of the pulse is "on", so frequency and pulse width matter as we will see. 

##3. Pulse Witdh / Duty Cycle

The pulse width of a signal applies to pulse signals (here we are mostly dealing with rectangular ones or )

##4. Frequency
