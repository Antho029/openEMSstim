# How should the connection look like

# getting started: what is what?

So what do we have here:


1. the openEMS control board (the open source device that Max and Tim designed, and I gently modded)
2. a off the shelve muscle stimulator (for instance a TENS / massage device you bought legally in your country/doctor/etc)
3. cables to connect the openEMS to the electrodes (which attacht to your skin and deliver impulses)
4. pre-gelled EMS/TENS electodes (again, off the shelve, medically compliant)
5. cables from your EMS/TENS device to the openEMS
6. A bluetooth 4.0 device for controlling the openEMS, a simple smartphone.


## 1. Testing the EMS signal generator first!

## 2. Testing the bluetooth connection. 

## 3. Connecting the EMS control module to an Android App.

## 4. Setting all levels to low, before any test.

## 5. Attaching electrodes to the muscles.

## 6. Plugging the EMS signal generator (TENS/EMS) to the board/module.

## 7. Test and iteratively calibrate yourself, step by step.

# Debbugging potential issues

Before debugging ANYTHING, TURN THE MACHINE OFF AND TAKE THE ELECTRODES OUT OF YOUR SKIN. Now we can start debugging. 

## I don't feel any EMS impulsesâ€¦

Okay, take it easy. This can be cause by multiple seeting in the signal path. So let's break it down into sub-questions:

### The EMS device is off.

Make sure the EMS device is on -- i.e., the signal generator that sends the impulses, a TENS machine, or a massage device. Most devices have a LED that shows you that pulses are coming out (they blink for each pulse, make sure to check that).

Important: some EMS devices (mostly the digital ones) shut off if the electrodes are not connected or if they detect a broken signal path (they are ttrying to help you, and proect the patient, so never circuinvent these protections). If this is happening it can be due to: 
1. openEMS board is off (so signal path is broken) 
2. the openEMS is on but the channels are closed and our EMS machine won't alow for operation, the safest is to select another EMS machine that continiously send pulses.  

### The openEMS board is off.

**Turn it on by safely connecting it to a 9V battery. **Please (triple) check the polarity if the battery before connecting. The modded boards have a safety diode to prevent inverse polarity but the awesome original design by Max and Tim does not and might break on inverted polarity.

If the board does not power after the 9V battery has been correctly inserted:
1. **Is the arduino in there?** openEMS uses a arduino nano on top, please inser the arduino correctly onto the vertical (black) pin headers. To inser the arduino correctly, check the pictures above, note that the USB port should face to the other side, oposite of the 9V connector (green header that goes to the battery). 
2. Is the 9V connector properly screwed to the board? Double check the power header with a simple screwdriver (and without the battery connected). 

### The LEDs of the openEMS do not light up when I send bluetooth messages.

1. Check if the board is powered. 
2. Is the bluetooth connection correctly estabelished? (blue LED is on?)
3. Are you sending the right messages (are you using the pre-built android app without any changes?)


### I'm not using the bluetooth LE / 4 (or I don't have a phone). 

If you are not using bluetooth (because you don't have a phone with BT 4.0 or any other reason). You can send Serial messages via USB, please check the documentation of the protocol how to send the correct serial messages. 

### The bluetooth app does not see the openEMS board. 

The best way to debug this is stage by stage:
1. do you have a phone with BT 4.0 / BLE? (or a device like a laptop equiped with bluetooth version 4 aka the Bluetooth Low Energy?)
2. Is the bluetooth on? (settings: enable bluetooth)
3. open a app that monitors the bluetooth connections on your device (for instance for android I recommend: BLE scanner). Does the device show up there?
4. Try to use the BLE scanner app to connect to the device. Does it connect (blue light of the openEMS goes on?)
5. If all above is true, you simply need to "restart" the EMS control apps, maybe they are buggy or got stuck. On an android you need to "close the app" to restart it", do not simply tap the home button (just suspends the app). Press the task switcher and swipe the app to close it. 


## The openEMS responds to bluetooth and EMS/TENS is sending signals but I don't feel anything.

This is the most senstive case, make sure you are sending small impulses to not harm yourself. Checj the following:
1. Are you connected to the board by attaching a pair of medically compliant EMS electrodes to your skin on a muscle (e.g., palm flexor of the right arm)?
2. The EMS setting might be too low. First, power all off and disconnect everything from the openEMS. The connect the elctrodes directly to the EMS machine, test it using the protocol descfibed above (on step "## 1. Testing the EMS signal generator first!"). Write down the value that you felt clearly on a piece of paper close to you. Now rewrire the openEMS and check if you can feel that same setting, you can optionally try a bit stonger (just a bit) since there is some power loss in the circuit, do not exceeed it too much. Feel it now?
3. The board you manufactured might be faulty. Disconnect and ask for help before trying anything further.
