# A space for collecting ideas regarding openEMSstim

## Hardware
1. Max reported that the ems modules work better on USB than 9V, this must be checked, I believe it is related to the 5V regulator used by the arduino. 
2. Add the voltage regulator
3. Add the protection FET (inverted to prevent reverse polarity)
4. Add a LiPo battery and a charging circuit
5. Change the connectors

## Documentation
1. Make an instructables page


## Software
1. Add apps to Google Play Store
2. Add app to App store (future iPhone app)


### Liability

Please refer to the liability waiver (in documentation/liability_waiver.md).
