# android using processing: openEMSstim-control

This is a simple processing app (mainly made to be invoked inside Android, the APK is there too). 
You can use it as the basis for your projects because you can clone it (copy paste it with a different name) and edit to create a new app that does much more exciting and interesting things. 

## How to mod this app to do what I want?

1. Get Processing (at least 3.0)  
2. Download the Libraries: controlP5 and (we also included them in /processing-libraries-for-dependencies)
3. Copy those libraries to your processing Library folder
4. Open processing, and switch it to ANDROID MODE
5. Open the project (for example: "OnOff-basics.pde") and execute it (will launch and install in a phone if connected or an emulator)
